# LTI-Circuits-Simulator-Based-on-Modified-Nodal-Analysis-Method-
This is the class project designed for the "Electrical Circuit" course in Winter/Spring 2016 (2nd semester/Academic year: 2015-2016)

Using MATLAB software and Chapter 12 of the textbook: Basic circuit theory, by Charles A. Ernest S. Koh 1970, McGraw Hill; Translation of this book in Persian with title of "Fundamental Theory of Circuits and Networks" has been done by Dr. Parviz Jobedar Maralani in two volumes und published by Tehran University Press.
This project can be used to analyze any LTI circuit.
 This program should include the following:
* All elements of Chapter 12, except generator, negative impedance converter and operational amplifier.
* The program must be able to analyze the circuit for each type of input (ac-dc).
* Receive circuit elements and user output output via text file.
* Obtaining full circuit response with zero-input and zero-state responces. 
* Calculate the total natural frequencies of the circuit.
* Obtaining the relation of the network function in the Laplace domain and drawing it in the frequency domain.
* Obtaining the relation of the impact response and drawing it in the time domain.
* The user's desired output can be voltage or current or network function or impact response or ... that the type of output must be specified by the user in the text file.
